# simsum
A django app that takes a facebook page handle and a twitter handle as inputs and tells whether the two handles belong to same person/organisation or not expressed on a scale of 0 to 100.

The dependencies are stored in the requirements.txt file in the main dir of the app folder. To directly install all the dependencies, run pip install -r requirements.txt

Once deployed, enter facebook handle and twitter handle as inputs.
Output will be a float value between 0 to 100.
