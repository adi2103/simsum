Aab yeh  humlogo(SRKIANS) k uper hai ki hum usse bohot zor sor se promote kare.\n\nSRK sir ki last 3 movies masala entertainer hone k karan box office per kaamal toh dikhai or worldwide audience ko entertain bhi kiya but script ki maang na hone k karan hum unki world class acting nhi dekh pae lekin iss saal unki world class acting puri duniya dekhegi. \n\n#FAN = SRK once said in an interview that he will made that 5 films for which his children will be proud of him in future and FAN movie is one of them. SRK's this statement telling the whole story that this is not an ordinary Bollywood movie and add to this there is no song in the movie(only one promotional song after the end of the movie) which stands this movie wholely to the international level, the director of the movie said the reason behind not giving any songs is because the movie is so emotional that songs will not find any place to match that emotions. According to Narmata Rao the editor of the movie this is one of a kind and most emotional movie and it's an action thriller. SRK sir in double role(Best actor award of the year for sure), makeup artist(Oscar wining), action director is one of the best in the world from Korea, film shoot in some awesome places like Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum London(1st movie in the world to be shoot on that place),Croatia etc. No need of heroin coz this movie is all about love and affection of FAN for his superstar but there is two newcomer girls.\n\nNote:- Haters and critics get ready to shut your mouth coz #FAN is going to give you a run for your life. \n\n#RAEES = \"Baniye ka dimaag Miyan Bhai ki daring........AA RAHA HU\". This dialogue is saying it all, its very hard to believe that a man who know as KING OF ROMANCE can win hearts of the world with his grey shade characters(Darr,Baazigar,Anjaam,Don,Don2) and #Raees is just that. SRK in grey shade character with killer looks, mind blowing dialogues & actions and world class performance of KING KHAN as a Villain. \nMany of SRKIANS including me like SRK in grey shade character more then a hero character, so it is compulsory that this movie is the most awaited movie of the year (tie with FAN). Plus point of this movie rather then SRK, his acting skills and killer looks are :1} Nawazudin siddique, one of the best talented actor of Bollywood is also featured in the movie as a brave and intelligent police officer. 2} Mahira Khan(debut), a very talented and beautiful actress across the border is playing the character of SRK's love interest in the movie.\n\nNote:- Clash or no Clash #RAEES will break box office records. Even critics and F#@king political parties can't help records from breaking.  \nSo ,with these awesome performers one can undoubtedly get an outstanding movie.\n\n\"In short 2016 belongs to KING KHAN literally\".\n\"Excitement level........... Believe me no one can imagine our(SRKIANS) excitement level for this 2 movies\"\n\n\"Yeh sab toh hai movies ki kuch khaas baatein but honestly, we #SRKIANS don't need any reason to watch SRK sir movies the only thing we are crazy about is SRK SRK and only SRK\".\n====KING WILL RULE AGAIN====", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-12 13:22:12"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Which Character Is You're Favourite ??", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-12 12:27:41"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Comment Fast Srk Fans", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-12 11:29:43"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "#Salman  #Aamir #Akshay #Ajay aur #Bollywood ke kuch naya naya actor saal me 2-3 movie kya release karne lage, Apne aapko KING samajhne lag gaye\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nLekin unn sabko pata nahi hai, Unka BAAP Shah Rukh Khan 2016 me TAHALKA machaane aa rahe hai.....!!", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-11 05:12:57"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Movie Name ??", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-11 05:00:03"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Cute Or Not ??", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-11 03:05:33"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Any one Know The Movie Name ??", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-10 05:32:14"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Good Morning Srk Fans :) & Have a Nice Day <3", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-10 00:19:28"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Srk Fans Guess The Movie Name ? :D", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-09 02:58:04"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Handsome Hunk <3", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-09 00:29:19"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Good Morning Srk Fans :) &  Have a Nice Day <3", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-08 22:41:33"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "Srkians Agree or Not ??", "pos": 100, "time": "2016-01-01 09:48:38"}, {"neg": 0, "message": "SRK FANS \n\nHere Wishing You Happy New Year  From\nOUR KING DILWALE SHAH RUKH KHAN \nFor His DILWALE FANS <3\n\nI WISH May God Gives U Lots Of Happiness And Good Health.
